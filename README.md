# Terrain simulation using p5.js
This is a fun little project I did to kill some time, it instantiate a grid of boxes and make them pass through an Perlin noise map, creating an wavy terrain like form. I have plans for optimizing this and set it as a header for my personal site, but this may never come to life.

# Running
To run simply donwload the repo and run index.html
